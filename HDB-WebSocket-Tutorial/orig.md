# [HarperDB](http://harperdb.io/link/ethanarrowood/blog) and WebSockets

> WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

TCP stands for transmission control protocol. It is a _reliable_ protocol; thus, it assures that the data being transmitted will be sent in its entirety (a.k.a. lossless). There are many different higher-level protocols based on TCP, each serving the general purpose of transmitting data from one point to another. HTTP, the main communication protocol of the internet, is an example of a high-level protocol many developers are familiar with. WebSocket operates similar to HTTP, but has its own variety of differences.

One of WebSocket's main principles is the **full-duplex** communication channels. These channels allow for simultaneous, bi-directional data transfer between the two peers. This means that at any time the systems at either end of a WebSocket connection can receive or send data.

HTTP differs in this principle because generally only the client can make requests to the server. The server completes the request, sends the response back to the client, and then waits to receive another request.

> I use "generally" here since new versions of HTTP have enabled things like [server push](https://www.cloudflare.com/website-optimization/http2/serverpush/).

Consider a chat application scenario:

![Chat Server Example. Four client nodes with bi-directional arrow pairs to a server](./chat-server-example.png)

All four clients need to be kept in sync. When _John_ **sends** a message, _Chris_, _Sam_, and _Jane_, should all **receive** it as quickly as possible. If this app is using HTTP, the **send** operation is simple, use a POST request to the server with the message. But the **receive** operation is a bit harder. Client's need to simultaneously be **polling** the server for new messages. Depending on the polling interval and the number of connected clients, the server could be looking at an alarming number of requests to handle.

With WebSockets, the flow is simplified significantly. All clients establish a connection with the server and begin **subscribe** to a certain **channel**. Any client (or the server) can **publish** a message to the specified **channel** at any time. When it does so, the server will then process the **publish** event, and depending on the implementation, will **broadcast** the new message to all client connections on the **channel**. This pattern is often dubbed as the _pub/sub model_. And is used by a plethora of applications, including [HarperDB clustering](https://harperdb.io/developers/documentation/clustering/link/ethanarrowood/blog)!

Internally, [HarperDB](http://harperdb.io/link/ethanarrowood/blog) clusters replicate data between instances using the bi-directional pub/sub model. Clients can subscribe to the same WebSocket channels HarperDB uses and access all of the updates of a given table. Using this mechanism, developers can build applications with close-to realtime data updates. To make this application development even easier, HarperDB has published a new module, [harperdb-websocket-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/harperdb-websocket-client).

Follow along with the demo below to see it in action.

## Demo

> The source code for this demo can be found at [Ethan-Arrowood/harperdb-websocket-tutorial](https://github.com/Ethan-Arrowood/harperdb-websocket-tutorial/tree/main/node-app)

This demo will walk you through the creation of a Node.js project powered by WebSockets and HarperDB. The application will be a data entry CLI with an additional display script.

### Prerequisites and Set Up

- [Node.js v14](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

Set your current working directory to a new folder:

```sh
mkdir hdb-websocket-demo
cd hdb-websocket-demo
```

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with these contents:

```yml
version: '2'
services:
  harperdb:
    image: harperdb/hdb:latest
    environment:
      - INIT_HDB_USERNAME=HDB_ADMIN
      - INIT_HDB_PASSWORD=password
      - INIT_CLUSTER_USER=cluster_user
      - INIT_CLUSTER_PASSWORD=password
      - INIT_ENABLE_CLUSTERING=true
      - INIT_NODE_NAME=docker_node
      - INIT_CLUSTER_PORT=12345
    ports:
      - 9925:9925
      - 31283:31283
      - 12345:12345
    volumes:
      - ./hdb_data/:/opt/harperdb/hdb/
```

Initialize a new npm project and install two dependencies:

```sh
npm i -y
npm i undici harperdb-websocket-client
```

Create three project files:

```sh
touch init.js data-entry.js data-display.js
```

And finally launch HarperDB using Docker

```sh
docker-compose up
```

### init.js

The init script contains some necessary set up operations so the CLI application has a schema and table to query against.

Start off by importing `undici`, initializing a new undici client, and creating two methods `requestFactory` and `readStream`.

> [undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici) is a new Node.js http 1.1 client. It is blazing fast and has a really extensible API.

```js
const undici = require('undici')

const client = new undici.Client('http://localhost:9925') // make sure to use the http port for the HarperDB instance

/**
 * This function takes a JSON operation and returns an undici
 * client request with the given operation stringified in the
 * `body` property.
 */
const requestFactory = op => client.request({
	path: '/',
	method: 'POST',
	headers: [
		'content-type', 'application/json',
		'authorization', 'Basic SERCX0FETUlOOnBhc3N3b3Jk' // this token was generated based off of the credential settings in docker-compose.yml
	],
	body: JSON.stringify(op)
})

/**
 * This is a helper function for processing the request responses.
 * Undici response `body` are returned as streams.
 */
const readStream = async stream => {
	let res = ''
	for await (let chunk of stream) {
		res += chunk
	}
	return res
}
```

Next, create four database operations using the `requestFactory` method

```js
const dropSchema = () => requestFactory({
	'operation': 'drop_schema',
	'schema': 'dev'
})

const createSchema = () => requestFactory({
	'operation': 'create_schema',
	'schema': 'dev'
})

const createTable = () => requestFactory({
	'operation': 'create_table',
	'schema': 'dev',
	'table': 'animals',
	'hash_attribute': 'id'
})

const describeTable = () => requestFactory({
	'operation': 'describe_table',
	'schema': 'dev',
	'table': 'animals'
})
```

Finally, define an immediately invoked function expression (iife) using async/await.

```js
;(async () => {
	await dropSchema()
	await createSchema()
	await createTable()

	// destructure the body property from the request response
	let { body } = await describeTable()
	// process the body stream
	let result = await readSTream(body)

	// sometimes the table creation fails so retry
	if (result.includes('Invalid table')) {
		await createTable()
		// re-destructure and process
		;({ body } = await describeTable())
		result = await readStream(body)
	}

	// Check the intended output in the next code block
	console.log(JSON.parse(result))

	// close the undici client
	client.close()
})()
```

Now, with the HarperDB Docker container running, run this script with `node init.js`. The output should look something like this (but with different times and id):

```sh
{
  __createdtime__: 1606254462088,
  __updatedtime__: 1606254462088,
  hash_attribute: 'id',
  id: 'dc42484f-0586-44c7-9e80-9d2f36b6a4ed',
  name: 'animals',
  residence: null,
  schema: 'dev',
  attributes: [
    { attribute: 'id' },
    { attribute: '__updatedtime__' },
    { attribute: '__createdtime__' }
  ],
  record_count: 0
}
```

### data-entry.js

Finally, some WebSocket action!

Start off by importing `readline` and `HarperDBWebSocketClient`, as well as initializing both:

> [readline](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) is a native Node.js library.

```js
const HarperDBWebSocketClient = require('harperdb-websocket-client')
const readline = require('readline')

// The credentials used here are specific to the docker-compose file defined earlier
const hdbClient = new HarperDBWebSocketClient({
	hostname: 'localhost',
	socketClusterOptions: {
		rejectUnauthorized: false,
		autoReconnect: false,
		ackTimeout: 10000,
		secure: true
	},
	port: 12345,
	username: 'cluster_user',
	password: 'password',
	implicitInit: true
})

const rl = readline.createInterface({
	input: process.stdin,
	output: process.stdout,
	// All of the \x1b things are color codes. When this runs in your terminal it should be multicolored!
	prompt: '\x1b[34mEnter new animal record, in the format <type>,<name>,<size>\nExample:\x1b[89m \x1b[36mdog,harper,medium\x1b[89m \n\x1b[91m>\x1b[39m '
})
```

Next, using the `rl` interface, create the basic CLI

```js
// kick off the cli
rl.prompt()
rl.on('line', line => {
	// for this demo we are skipping any kind of input validation.

	// trim the input, split it up into an array, and then trim each entry.
	// desctructure into three variables
	const [ type, name, size ] = line.trim().split(',').map(v => v.trim())

	// Some useful debug info
	console.log(`\x1b[33mInserting new animal record: ${JSON.stringify({ type, name, size })}\x1b[89m`)

	// âœ¨ insert the new record using the websocket client
	hdbClient.insert('dev:animals', [
		{ type, name, size }
	])

	// prompt the user again for subsequent data entry
	rl.prompt()
}).on('close', () => {
	// print out a nice message when the user ends the CLI session
	console.log('\n\x1b[92mThank you for using HarperDB Animal Data Entry CLI\x1b[39m')
	process.exit(0) // exit safely
})
```

The core to this demo is quite short, `hdbClient.insert('dev:animals', [{ type, name, size }])` is all you need to insert records over WebSockets! The client also supports `.update` and `.delete`. At this time, the WebSocket client cannot manage things like users, tables, or schemas.

Try running the new script with `node data-entry.js`. The following image shows what is output in my terminal interface.

![A terminal screenshot. The first line is my bash profile header styled and says "âžœ  node-app git:(main) node data-entry.js". The second line is in purple and says "Enter new animal record, in the format <type>,<name>,<size>". The third line is purple and blue and says "Example: dog,harper,medium". The fourth line is red and white and says "> cat,garfield,large". The fifth line is yellow and says "Inserting new animal record: {"type":"cat","name":"garfield","size":"large"}". The second, third, and start of the fourth line repeat themselves one more time.](./data-entry-output.png)

Great! The CLI is working, but we can't actually see the new records... onto _data-display.js_.

## data-display.js

Start again by importing and initializing `HarperDBWebSocketClient`.

```js
const HarperDBWebSocketClient = require('harperdb-websocket-client')

const hdbClient = new HarperDBWebSocketClient({
	hostname: 'localhost',
	socketClusterOptions: {
		rejectUnauthorized: false,
		autoReconnect: false,
		ackTimeout: 10000,
		secure: true
	},
	port: 12345,
	username: 'cluster_user',
	password: 'password',
	implicitInit: true
})
```

Next, subscribe to the table the `data-entry` script is inserting records into.

```js
hdbClient.subscribe('dev:animals', data => {
	const record = data.transaction.records[0]
	console.log(`New record ${record.id} inserted`)
})
```

âœ¨ And just like that, now _data-display_ will log every time a new record is added to the table!

With the Docker container and the _data-entry_ script running, open up another terminal and run `node data-display.js`.

Go back to the _data-entry_ terminal and enter a new record. You should see a new ID in the _data-display_ terminal.

The following screenshot shows the same output from _data-entry_ as before, but also with the _data-display_ output on the right.

![A split-terminal screenshot. On the left-side: The first line is my bash profile header styled and says "âžœ  node-app git:(main) node data-entry.js". The second line is in purple and says "Enter new animal record, in the format <type>,<name>,<size>". The third line is purple and blue and says "Example: dog,harper,medium". The fourth line is red and white and says "> cat,garfield,large". The fifth line is yellow and says "Inserting new animal record: {"type":"cat","name":"garfield","size":"large"}". The second, third, and start of the fourth line repeat themselves one more time. On the right-side: The first line is my bash profile header styled and says "âžœ  node-app git:(main) node data-display.js". The second line is in white and says "New record e9923250-e316-4483-9de0-08f25204e320 inserted".](./data-display-output.png)

Great work! Now enter as many records as you like and see how the WebSocket connections almost instantaneously output the new records. And for a special trick, try opening two more terminals. Run both scripts again so that you have two terminal instances for each script. Enter a record on the first _data-entry_ terminal and see it output in both _data-display_ process. Enter another record in the second _data-entry_ terminal and see it also output in both _data-display_ processes! WebSockets are pretty awesome.
